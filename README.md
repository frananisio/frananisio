## Hi there! I'm Maria Francielly ❤️

Student Researcher | Electronics Technician at IFPE | PDA'23 | P4G'23

## 📖 About Me

I am currently a student at the Federal Institute of Pernambuco in the integrated technical course in Electronics. I have been passionate about technology since I had my first computer. Because of this, I am always trying to get more knowledge in the area in order to create and carry out projects that always interest me. As a consequence of my admiration for technology, I met programming and at the same moment I realized that I wanted to make it my professional career. Since I was young I have always been interested in learning a new language, since English is very important for programming, I improve it every day and with that I was able to become a volunteer on a streaming platform Viki, in which I had the opportunity to have contact with several cultures and languages, as well as increase my level of proficiency in English.
